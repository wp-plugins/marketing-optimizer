Optimize conversion rates by A/B testing your Wordpress site: test all your content for its effect on conversions, including landing pages.

== Description ==

= Conversion Rate Optimization Plugin =
A/B testing is the process of showing visitors one of two (or more) versions of the same web page, and then tracking which one created the most revenue, leads, signups, downloads, purchases, registrations, or comments. Every page on your Wordpress site contributes to conversion rates, not just the landing page or pages with a feedback form. To really bring your marketing 'A-Game', you need to test every important page to see how it contributes to your bottom line. 
= A/B Test Multiple Pages =
Landing pages are the obvious choice for A/B testing. You are already sending traffic to them, and if converting visitors on the landing page is your goal, testing different version is a must. Every page on your website that receives traffic contributes to conversions, and it pays to test those, too. Your report will include the results for each page variant and the conversion rate of visitors that saw that version. 
= Track Conversions Accurately =
Chances are you have at least one page that acts as your 'confirmation' or 'thank you' page for visitors that have just converted. You can now track all of these conversions with a simple shortcode that lets the system know that the visitor has just completed a successful conversion, and the proper version of all the web pages that visitor saw is credited with a conversion. This allows you to have many different conversion goal pages and still track all your conversions in properly.
= Automatically Promote Winners =
When you have completed your test, and there is a clear winner, just click the 'Promote' button. This replaces the old page with the content from the winning variation automatically. 
= Adjustable Multi-Armed Bandit =
The 'Multi-Armed Bandit', or Epsilon Greedy, method of rotating variations has been proven to be the very fastest way to determine a winner. Not only that, but it's also, by far, the most profitable way to display your test pages. Here's how it works: the page with the highest conversion rate gets 90% of the traffic ('Exploitation'), and the other variations are randomly rotated through the remaining 10% of the time ('Exploration'). In other words, 90% of the time the system chooses the best version of your page. The rest of the time it explores new variations in the hopes that they will prove to be a better solution.
Since sometimes it makes more sense to explore more than 10%, you have the ability to simply move the slider to explore between  10% and 100%. 
= Create Variations Quickly =
To make things easier and faster we have built-in the ability to clone either the control (original version of your page) or a variation as a new test. Take this copy of your existing page and make any changes you think might improve conversion rates. You don't have to start from scratch, but you have the freedom to make any changes you want. 
Some common changes that have been shown to increase conversion rates are:

* Changes to headlines
* Changes to site layout
* Changes to layout
* Change images
* Adding testimonials
* Button types and styles
* Adding trust symbols 
* Changes to feedback forms
* Call to action placement

= Marketing Optimizer Integration =
This plugin is a must for current subscribers to the Marketing Optimizer software. It includes automatic Marketing Optimizer javascript publishing code, phone tracking integration, and more.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Which pages should I create variations of first =

You should create variations of your pages in the following order:

1. Landing pages
2. Conversion pages (Contact Us)
3. Highly trafficked pages

= Which pages should I test first =

You should test as many pages as possible as soon as possible, and all at once. The system will accurately track any experiments you want to run, all concurrently. This will allow you to start accumulating data more quickly, which will show you the winner more quickly.
